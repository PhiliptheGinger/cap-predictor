# Cognitive Linguistics Overview

## Image Schemas
Image schemas are recurring spatial patterns that structure our understanding of experience. They provide a basic scaffold for reasoning. For example, the **container** schema frames "in" and "out":

> The stock is *in* a downturn.

Here, market performance is conceptualized as being inside or outside a bounded region.

## Analogy
Analogy maps knowledge from one domain to another to highlight similarities. It supports explanations by linking new ideas to familiar ones. For instance:

> Earnings season is like a school report cardâ€”past efforts are graded and future expectations are set.

This analogy connects corporate financial reporting with an everyday evaluation process.

## Simulator
A simulator mentally enacts scenarios to anticipate outcomes. It allows us to explore consequences without acting in the real world. Example:

> Imagine lowering interest rates: investors rush in, prices climb, and momentum builds.

The mind runs a simulation of a rate cut to predict market behavior.
