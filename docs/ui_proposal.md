# CAP Predictor UI Proposal

This document outlines a user-accessible UI for the CAP Predictor platform. It incorporates a persistent chatbot assistant, monitoring dashboards, asset-level performance views, decision-traceability, and accessibility considerations. It also sketches integration points with Mistral data sourcing and DeepSeek implementations.

## 1. Persistent Chatbot Assistant
- Docked chat panel that remains visible across screens, powered by an LLM.
- Provides context-aware explanations of models, outputs, and code snippets.
- Supports exporting conversation history for audits and collaboration.
- Optional session-level memory so it can tailor responses to user actions.

## 2. Visual Monitoring Dashboards
- **Main Model Dashboard**: real-time metrics (accuracy, latency), historical trends, and deployment status.
- **Experimental Model Dashboard**: compare experimental models against the main model with feature importance charts and hyperparameter summaries.
- Uses WebSockets for live updates and allows promoting an experimental model when it outperforms the baseline.

## 3. Asset-Level Performance Views
- Drill-down interface to inspect predictions vs. actuals for individual assets.
- Filters by asset type, region, or time frame and supports CSV/JSON export.
- Scatter plots and sortable tables facilitate quick investigation of outliers.

## 4. Decision Logic Traceability
- "Explain this prediction" button opens a trace explorer showing feature values and model contributions.
- Each interaction is logged with timestamps and user IDs, supporting audits and version diffing.

## 5. Accessibility Design
- **Professional Mode**: dense tables, advanced filters, and code snippets.
- **Beginner Mode**: simplified visuals with guided tooltips and walkthroughs.
- WCAG-compliant colors, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, adjustable fonts, and dark/light themes.

## 6. Integration with Mistral and DeepSeek
- **Mistral Data Sourcing**: dashboard panel shows dataset provenance, update schedules, and quality metrics derived from Mistral pipelines. Chatbot can reference data lineage when answering questions.
- **DeepSeek Implementations**: experimental models deployed on DeepSeek infrastructure with metrics surfaced in dashboards. Decision traces link to DeepSeek-hosted model configs.

## 7. Technology Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript using a component library and Plotly/D3 for charts.
- Backend: FastAPI routes backed by PostgreSQL and Redis; WebSockets for live metrics.
- Chatbot: Mistral or DeepSeek LLM APIs with a context manager for conversation state.
- Deployment: Dockerized services orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.

## 8. Next Steps
1. Create wireframes for chat assistant, dashboards, and asset views.
2. Prototype backend services for metrics retrieval and trace logging.
3. Implement accessibility toggles for professional/beginner modes.
4. Integrate Mistral data pipelines and DeepSeek model endpoints.
5. Iterate with user testing to refine the interface and workflow.
